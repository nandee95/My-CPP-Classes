<h1>Collection of my C++ classes</h1>

This is a collection of my C++ classes that I think might come useful for someone or me in the future.

I started documenting and licensing the classes.

Detailed documentation of the listed classes can be found in the source code!

<h3>WinAPI / ProcessMemory.hpp</h3>
This class capable of reading and writing values through multi level pointers from any process's memory. The process can be opened by window title or executable name.
